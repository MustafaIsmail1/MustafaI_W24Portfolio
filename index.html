        <p>Full Stack Developer</p>
        <p>Royal Bank of Canada</p>
        <p>200 Bay Street</p>
        <p>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</p>
        <br>
        <p>March 17th 2024</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dear Mr/Mrs Hiring Manager,</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am applying for the Full Stack Developer position you currently have advertised on Indeed.
         I am a student at George Brown College and I am currently working on getting my Advanced Diploma in 
         Computer Programming and Analysis. I have years of experience using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, 
         SQL, and C#. I have the tools necessary for the job, and I meet all the requirements for the position.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a student at George Brown, I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in several projects. I have created
         and designed multiple websites ranging from sneaker shops to company websites. In PHP, I have built websites that
         created accounts using login and signup features. The accounts created were stored in a database, and the website was 
         inaccessible without an account. The college experience allowed me to learn important skills and to develop the confidence 
         needed to succeed in a competitive environment. My experience in multiple workplaces have allowed me to excel at working in a team and being a leader.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. Here is my contact information, I am available for any calls or interviews. 
        My phone number is 647-915-7850, and my email is mustafaismailmab@gmail.com</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
        <p>Mustafa Ismail</p>
